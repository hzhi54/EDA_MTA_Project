# Project MVP

## Goals
We are trying to set up street teams that could get people to invovle in the Summer gala provided by WTWY organizations. Our goal is to get as much participants to join the gala by the start of the Summer.

Here we use the MTA turnstile data starting from Janurary 2021 to May 2021 because we want the participant to sign up and be ready before Summer starts.

Lets look at what we have analyze:

MTA top ten populated stations:

MTA population during the weekdays:

So far, we notice that we can use the top 5 stations to set street teams because they are the most populated area in the MTA subway stations. Also, we can focus on setting the team during the weekdays instead of the weekends because there are not much during the weekends. So working on setting up street teams on the top 5 stations during the weekdays is the best option for now.
